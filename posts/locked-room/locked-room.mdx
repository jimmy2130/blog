A boy was locked in a room, and he had to find a way to escape. There was a table in the room, and on top of it lay a key. However, the key didn’t fit in the lock. Looking around, the boy didn’t find anything that could help him escape.

He yelled as loud as possible, but it seemed like there was no one out there. As the boy became desperate, he started weeping. He had no idea why he couldn't leave the place, nor could he recall anyone who had brought him here. 

Several minutes later, the boy sighed, deciding to get some sleep. “Maybe it's just a dream,” he thought. Just when he turned off the light, something happened.

In the darkness of the room, there were some written numbers glowing on the wall. The boy stared at it amazingly, and he instantly turned on the light.

The magical numbers disappeared.

Discovering the new clues, the boy started looking for any hidden places that had to do with numbers. Ceiling? No. Walls? No. Suddenly, he noticed a faint noise coming from the table.

The boy crawled under the table, and found a small screen. He quickly entered the number, and the door opened.

“That’s quite simple,” the boy thought.

Standing in the middle of the room, he grinned, and then started laughing. It seemed so ridiculous that three minutes ago, he had thought he would never find a way to get out of this place. It turned out it was just a simple trick after all.

He looked back at the screen, where he just entered the code. How could he not find it at the first place?

Shaking his head, the boy let out his breath in a long sigh of relief. Not bothering to help clean the room, he left, leaving the door wide open.
